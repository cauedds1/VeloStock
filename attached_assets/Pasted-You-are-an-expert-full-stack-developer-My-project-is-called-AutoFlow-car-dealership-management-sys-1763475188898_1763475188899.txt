You are an expert full-stack developer. My project is called AutoFlow (car dealership management system).  
EVERYTHING the user sees must be 100% in perfect Brazilian Portuguese. Never write English in the interface.

Current status:
- Already works with vehicles, photos, costs, kanban, checklist, OpenAI announcement generator
- Currently single-tenant (only Capoeiras Automóveis data)
- Uses OpenAI and has WhatsApp integration capacity.

RULES THAT CAN NEVER BE BROKEN – ZERO DATA LOSS:
1. Before ANY change in the database → create a full backup in /backups/backup-antes-de-[feature-name]-dd-mm-yyyy-hh-mm.json
2. Never delete or rename tables/columns → only ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS
3. Always migrate old data automatically to the new structure
4. After each successful migration show toast: “Backup automático criado com sucesso em /backups”
5. Create menu Configurações → Backup with list + download + manual backup button

Implement ALL the features below IN THIS EXACT ORDER. Do ONE feature at a time, test 100 %, and only continue after I say “próxima” or “continua”.

1. Multi-tenant + total data protection
   - Table “empresas” with all fields (nome_fantasia, razao_social, cnpj, endereco, telefones, email, logo_url, cor_primaria, cor_secundaria, whatsapp_numero, locais_comuns_json)
   - Add empresa_id (NOT NULL) in ALL existing tables
   - First access → company registration screen
   - Automatically migrate ALL current Capoeiras data to a company named “Capoeiras Automóveis” (red colors)

2. Custom theme 100 % per company (logo + primary and secondary colors)

3. Physical location of the vehicle
   - New field “localizacao_atual” in veículos + select with the locations that the owner registers in Configurações → Locais Comuns
   - Make location field MANDATORY when changing status (except “Vendido” and “Entregue”)

4. WhatsApp integration (Evolution API or webhook)
   - Status change → send message to the company’s WhatsApp group
   - Daily alert at 9 am and weekly voice note report every Saturday at 8 am

5. Automatic FIPE + AI price suggestion
   - Button “Buscar FIPE” + AI suggestion of ideal selling price (considering cost + desired margin)

6. 100 % responsive mobile (dashboard + kanban + vehicle screen)

7. Advanced announcement generator: 3 styles (barato / completo / urgente) + hashtags + one-click copy with up to 20 resized photos

8. Commission control (vendedores table + automatic calculation + monthly PDF)

9. Smart alerts (daily at 9 am): cars stopped > configurable days, ready without photos, ready without price

10. Force photo + note when advancing any Kanban stage

11. 10 configurable Kanban columns (owner can rename)

12. Dashboard with cards: ready cars, in preparation, sold this month, average margin, average days in stock

13. Voice commands via WhatsApp
    → user sends “Grok/AutoFlow, onde está o Onix?” or audio → system replies with current location, photo and status
14. Automatic evaluation by photo sent on WhatsApp → creates draft vehicle with estimated value
15. Auto-reply on WhatsApp Business when client asks “tem Creta?”, “tem Onix?”, etc.
16. Daily detective message to owner at 9 am with all problems
17. Weekly voice note report (Saturday 8 am)
18. Change log (who changed price/status/cost and when)
19. PWA installable (manifest + service worker)
20. Export announcement export with up to 20 photos automatically resized
21. Menu Configurações → Backup (list + download + manual button)
22. Button “Fazer backup agora” that also offers Google Drive option (future)

All texts, buttons, toasts, notifications, WhatsApp messages → perfect Brazilian Portuguese.

Start RIGHT NOW with feature 1 (multi-tenant + backup) and wait for my “próxima” before continuing.

Do everything with extreme caution and perfection.
