VeloStock – Fully Built, Brand-New Multi-Tenant SaaS for Vehicle Dealerships (Cars / Motorcycles / Trucks) 100% Finished • Mobile-First • Multi-Tenant • GPT-4 Native • Pre-Revenue (Clean Slate)

VeloStock is a brand-new, never-launched, zero-customer SaaS platform built specifically for car, motorcycle, and truck dealerships.
The system is fully complete, fully tested, fully documented — and has never been marketed, meaning the buyer gets a clean, zero-legacy product with no old pricing, no support history, no churn, and no technical debt from users.

A public live demo is already populated with 34 real vehicles (Civic, Corolla, BMW, Onix, Argo, etc.) including real photos, documents, checklists, costs, and complete historical data.

This is a rare opportunity to acquire a fresh, untouched, production-ready SaaS that can be launched globally — the system already includes English support and can be adapted to any country’s vehicle market.

? Why This SaaS Is Valuable

Brand-new (“virgin”) platform: never sold, never used commercially — you start with a clean slate.

No legacy users, no legacy pricing, no backlog, no bugs reported by paying clients.

Immediate revenue potential: competitors charge $25–$80/mo for far fewer features.

100% ready for commercialization: buyer can start charging customers immediately.

High-demand niche: vehicle dealerships worldwide require digital inventory + CRM + financial control.
